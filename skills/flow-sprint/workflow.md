# flow-sprint Workflow

**Goal:** maintain sprint state in `docs/flow/sprint.yaml`. Stories are the unit of work; epics group them; status flows backlog → doing → review → done. Every status change also invokes the active issue-tracker adapter to keep external state in sync.

**Schema invariants** (validated on every write):
- `stories[].id` matches `^E\d+-S?\d{1,3}[a-z]?$`. Accepted forms:
  - Flow native — `E1-001`, `E1-002`, … (zero-padded three-digit)
  - BMad-style — `E1-S1`, `E2-S10`, `E3-S9b`, … (kept when migrated from `bmad-create-story` output to preserve continuity)
  - Both forms can coexist in the same sprint.yaml. `flow-sprint add` continues whichever form the epic already uses.
- `stories[].status` in `[backlog, doing, review, done, cancelled]`
- Exactly zero or one story may be in `doing` at any time (enforce one-story-at-a-time per dev unless `mode: team`)

<step n="1" goal="Parse subcommand and arguments">
  <action>Parse argv:
    - First positional = subcommand
    - Remaining args interpreted per subcommand
  </action>

  <action>Resolve paths from `flow.config.yaml`:
    - `{{sprint_file}}` = config.sprint_file (default `docs/flow/sprint.yaml`)
    - `{{stories_dir}}` = config.stories_dir (default `docs/flow/stories`)
    - `{{deferred_file}}` = config.deferred_file (default `docs/flow/deferred.md`)
    - `{{archive_dir}}` = `docs/flow/archive`
    - `{{retros_dir}}` = `docs/flow/retros`

    <action>Compute the next story id for this epic — **detect format from existing stories first**:
      1. Collect existing stories in this epic: `{{epic_stories}}` = stories where `epic == {{epic_id}}`.
      2. Determine `{{id_format}}`:
         - If `{{epic_stories}}` is non-empty: inspect the FIRST entry's id.
           - Matches `^E\d+-S\d+[a-z]?$` → format = `bmad` (e.g. `E1-S1`).
           - Matches `^E\d+-\d{3}$`        → format = `flow-native` (e.g. `E1-001`).
           - Anything else                  → HALT with "Unrecognized story-id format in epic {{epic_id}}: {{first.id}}. Fix sprint.yaml or pass --id-format=flow-native|bmad."
         - If `{{epic_stories}}` is empty: use `flow.config.yaml > sprint.default_id_format` (default `bmad` post-migration, `flow-native` for greenfield projects).
      3. Compute next numeric: `{{next_num}}` = max(parsed numeric part of each existing id) + 1; start at 1 for empty epics.
      4. Render `{{story_id}}` per format:
         - `bmad`         → `E{{epic_num}}-S{{next_num}}` (no zero-padding; e.g. `E1-S11`)
         - `flow-native`  → `E{{epic_num}}-{{next_num.toString().padStart(3, '0')}}` (e.g. `E1-011`)
